# Trivia-game-builder - Team Ministry of Magic

## User Story:

AS A USER that wants to create a trivia game 
I WANT TO be able to choose the subject, number of questions, difficulty and be able to either add my own questions or modify the ones that are generated.
SO THAT I can print out the quiz and questions or play the quiz live on the screen.

Our goal is to resolve your entertainment dilemma. Here is a ready to use
solution, all you have to do is generate random trivia quizzes from a category of your choice. You can then
determine the number of questions each quiz will have. Each question is timed to ensure quick response and
guarantee group participation and fun! Once your quiz is generated you can both print that quiz and or execute it to be displayed on a screen.
